Inter-domain routing is an important component to allow interoperation
among heterogeneous network domains operated by different
organizations.  Although inter-domain routing has been well supported
in the Internet, there has been relatively little support to the
Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) space.  In MANETs, the inter-domain
routing problem is challenged by: (1) dynamic network topology due to mobility, and
(2) diverse intra-domain ad hoc routing protocols.  In this paper, we
discuss how to enable inter-domain routing among MANETs, and to
handle the dynamic nature of MANETs. We first present the design challenges 
for inter-domain routing in MANETs, and then propose a framework for
inter-domain routing in MANETs.
