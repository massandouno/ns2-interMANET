Inter-domain routing offers a means for heterogeneous MA-NETs to interoperate with each other. This paper has identified the challenges of inter-domain routing in MANETs, and proposed IDRM as a viable solution. This paper has shown that, despite dynamic network topology and diverse intra-domain ad hoc routing protocols, opaque interoperation among heterogeneous multi-domain MANETs can be supported. We also discussed how IDRM can support network operators to specify inter-domain routing policies in a similar manner as BGP. This is an important feature to encourage interoperation among multiple MANET domains in practice. We expect that IDRM will improve the end-to-end reachability of mobile users, and consequently enhance the usefulness of MANETs.
