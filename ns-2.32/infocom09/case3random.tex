\subsection{Scenario 3: Random Topology}
\label{sec:case3}
In the previous examples, we illustrate the effectiveness of IDRM
with two simple scenarios. 
In this sections, we consider a more complex scenario with 
random topology. 
We randomly deployed 60 nodes in a 1000x1000 $m^{2}$ area,
and the random waypoint mobility mode is used.
Two average speed settings, 1.34m/s and 13.4m/s, 
are used to simulate walking and driving speed.
Also, we study the performance of IDRM with different percentage of
gateways and different number of domains.
