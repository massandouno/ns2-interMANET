This paper proposes a solution for inter-doman routing in ad hoc MANET's. The authors identify requirements for inter-domain routing and show that BGP and current ad hoc network protocols do not meet these needs (for example, domain partitioning due to mobility). A specific scheme called IDRM is described and routing algorithms used are given in detail using pseudo code. Although a complete validation of the protocol is not given, the paper concludes with an analysis of the routing overhead, which is shown to be reasonable.

The paper is well written. It outlines as routing protocol for an ad-hos network consisting of multiple domains. The case is insufficiently made that such a network would arise in Vehicular Ad-Hoc networks - but if you accepts that there is a need, then this design would appear to fill it. The analysis is reaonably thorough

The authors present a scheme for inter-domain routing in MANETs including a high-level description of the inter-domain routing protocol. The paper is very well written, and as far as I know, this is novel work.

Some detailed comments:

In sec 2.1, I assume that you mean 92.168.{1,2}.0/24, and not /8 (four occurences).

Sec 3.1.3: "destination c_1": is this a gateway, MANET ID, node ID, or membership digest? Perhaps I am just confused by comparing with BGP where this is an IP prefix. Since you don't make any syntactic distinction from the path components (a_1 and b_1), my guess is that c_1 is also a gateway. But then, where do the membership digests come into the equation?

Algo 1: I was confused for a long time by the un-intuitive syntax in the first if-clause (withdraw[MD, path] <- [MD, path]). Moving the comment ("// store old route announcement...") up two lines would help!

Sec 3.2 second paragraph, "see Section 3.1.2 for how to obtain M(i)": I don't find any more than that this is "a plain membership digest" in Sec 3.1.2.

Algo 2: perhaps a nit, but shouldn't there be a check in the second if-clause that you previously announced the route that now is withdrawn? (that it existed in the path vector)

Algo 3: isn't the last if-clause (generating new route announcement) already taken care of by Algo 2???

Sec 4 on the overhead analysis: isn't the size of the membership digest a factor important for this analysis?
